To learn Software Configuration Management (SCM) and provisioning using Puppet, start by 

understanding manifests, which are the primary files containing Puppet code to define the 

desired configuration for a system. Manifests describe resources such as packages, services, 

and files, allowing you to specify what should be installed or configured on the nodes. 

Familiarize yourself with the syntax and structure of manifests, as they are essential for 

defining the state of your infrastructure.

Next, explore modules, which are collections of manifests and related files organized in a 

structured manner for better management and reuse. Each module typically focuses on a 

specific aspect of configuration, making it easier to share across different projects. 

Understand how to create classes within these modules to encapsulate related functionality, 

allowing for modular and organized code. Additionally, learn about functions, which enable 

you to define reusable code snippets that can be called within manifests and classes, 

enhancing code efficiency and maintainability. By mastering these core components, you'll 

be well-equipped to effectively manage and provision infrastructure using Puppet.
